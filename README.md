This project focuses on enhancing marketing strategies and boosting sales in online retail by analyzing a UK-based retailer's transactional data from 2010 to 2011. By transforming transactional data into a customer-centric dataset and creating new features, customers are segmented into distinct groups using the K-means clustering algorithm. This segmentation reveals unique customer profiles and preferences, enabling the development of a recommendation system that suggests top-selling products to each segment, improving marketing efficacy and increasing sales.
The dataset is within the data.zip file, save and extract the file to use the dataset.
